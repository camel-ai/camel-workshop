    "\n",
    "This cookbook shows how to build a powerful object detection agent using CAMEL AI connected to ACI.dev's MCP tools. We'll create an agent that analyzes images, detects objects like cars or trees, and explains results in natural language—all without writing complex ML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learnings:**\n",
    "- Why agents need tools to be truly useful.\n",
    "- How MCP enables dynamic, aware tool usage for tasks like object detection.\n",
    "- Setting up CAMEL with ACI.dev for real-time image analysis.\n",
    "- Building and running your own object detection agent.\n",
    "- Handling outputs with summaries, tables, and visualized results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup uses CAMEL's `MCPToolkit` to connect to ACI.dev's MCP servers, powering object detection via Replicate's ML models."
